'''
Use a list comprehension to extract the year column from data.
Because the year column is the second column in the data, you'll need to get the element at index 1 in each row.
Assign the result to the variable years.
Create an empty dictionary called year_counts.
Loop through each element in years.
If the element isn't a key in year_counts, create it, and set the value to 1.
If the element is a key in year_counts, increment the value by one.
Display year_counts to see how many gun deaths occur in each year.
